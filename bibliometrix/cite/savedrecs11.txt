AB Epidemiological studies indicate that exposure to persistent organic pollutants is positively associated with the prevalence of obesity. To delineate the potential role of technical-grade chlordane in obesity development, chlordane metabolism and chlordane-induced metabolic changes were investigated in mice fed high-fat diet (HFD) over a 6-week period. Gas chromatography electron capture detector analysis showed that HFD induced more accumulation of technical chlordane in the liver, muscle and adipose tissue. The enantioselectivities of oxychlordane in selected tissues were also influenced by HFD. H-1 NMR-based liver metabolome indicated that technical chlordane can enhance the metabolic alterations induced by HFD. Compared with the low-fat diet (LFD) group, no differences were observed in the LFD + chlordane group. However, as many as 16 metabolites were significantly different between the HFD group and HFD + chlordane group. Moreover, compared to the LFD + chlordane group, the abundances of 24 metabolites significantly increased or decreased in the HFD + chlordane group. Twenty metabolites were altered in the HFD group compared to the LFD group. Tryptophan profiling suggested that both chlordane and HFD can disturb tryptophan catabolism. These interactions between technical chlordane and HFD suggest that technical chlordane is a candidate obesogen. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
