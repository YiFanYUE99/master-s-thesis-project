AB PEN is a widely used triazole fungicide, usually used to control grape white rot. In the process of agricultural use, PEN will be scattered to the soil and water environment, which brings certain environmental safety risks. In this study, we used a 200-mu g/L solution of Rac-PEN, (+)-PEN, and (-)-PEN to perform a 28-day exposure test on zebrafish. The results showed that long-term low-dose PEN exposure did not significantly change the growth factor K and the number of spawning of zebrafish. However, the content of four important hormones vitellogenin, 17 beta-estradiol, testosterone, and 11-ketotestosterone in zebrafish has changed significantly. Furthermore, we measured the expression of hypothalamus-pituitary-gonads-liver (HPGL) axis-related genes, and the results showed that the expressions of related genes in the brain, gonads, and liver all changed significantly. Combining the above results, we can conclude that PEN has obvious endocrine disrupting effect on zebrafish, and has gender-specific endocrine effects. Meanwhile, Rac-PEN and (+)-PEN had stronger effects on the endocrine system of zebrafish than (-)-PEN.
