AB Quantitative structure-retention relationship models (QSRR) have been utilized as an alternative to costly and time-consuming separation analyses and associated experiments for predicting retention time. However, achieving 100 % accuracy in retention prediction is unrealistic despite the existence of various tools and approaches. The limitations of vast data availability and time complexity hinder the use of most algorithms for retention prediction. Therefore, in this study, we examined and compared two approaches for modelling retention time using a dataset of small molecules with retention times obtained at multiple conditions, referred to as multi-targets (five pH levels: 2.7, 3.5, 5, 6.5, and 8 at gradient times of 20 min of mobile phase). The first approach involved developing separate models for predicting retention time at each condition (single-target approach), while the second approach aimed to learn a single model for predicting retention across all conditions simultaneously (multi-target approach). Our findings highlight the advantages of the multi-target approach over the single-target modelling approach. The multi-target models are more efficient in terms of size and learning speed compared to the single-target models. These retention prediction models offer two-fold benefits. Firstly, they enhance knowledge and understanding of retention times, identifying molecular descriptors that contribute to changes in retention behaviour under different pH conditions. Secondly, these approaches can be extended to address other multi-target property prediction problems, such as multi-quantitative structure Property(X) relationship studies (mt-QS(X)R).
