AB In plant biology, metabolomics is often used to quantitatively assess small molecules, metabolites, and their intermediates in plants. Metabolomics has frequently been applied to detect metabolic alterations in plants exposed to various biotic and abiotic stresses, including pesticides. The widespread use of pesticides and agrochemicals in intensive crop production systems is a serious threat to the functionality and sustainability of agroecosystems. Pesticide accumulation in soil may disrupt soil-plant relationships, thereby posing a pollution risk to agricultural output. Application of metabolomic techniques in the assessment of the biological consequences of pesticides at the molecular level has emerged as a crucial technique in exposome investigations. State-of-the-art metabolomic approaches such as GC-MS, LC-MS/MS UHPLC, UPLC-IMS-QToF, GC/EI/MS, MALDI-TOF MS, and H-1-HR-MAS NMR, etc., investigating the harmful effects of agricultural pesticides have been reviewed. This updated review seeks to outline the key uses of metabolomics related to the evaluation of the toxicological impacts of pesticides on agronomically important crops in exposome assays as well as bench-scale studies. Overall, this review describes the potential uses of metabolomics as a method for evaluating the safety of agricultural chemicals for regulatory applications. Additionally, the most recent developments in metabolomic tools applied to pesticide toxicology and also the difficulties in utilizing this approach are discussed.
