AB The extensive application of pesticides in agricultural production has raised significant concerns about its impact on human health. Different pesticides, including fungicides, insecticides, and herbicides, cause environmental pollution and health problems for non-target organisms. Infants and young children are so vulnerable to the harmful effects of pesticide exposure that early-life exposure to pesticides deserves focused attention. Recent research lays emphasis on understanding the mechanism between negative health impacts and early-life exposure to various pesticides. Studies have explored the impacts of exposure to these pesticides on model organisms (zebrafish, rats, and mice), as well as the mechanism of negative health effects, based on advanced methodologies like gut microbiota and multi-omics. These methodologies help comprehend the pathogenic mechanisms associated with early-life pesticide exposure. In addition to presenting health problems stemming from early-life exposure to pesticides and their pathogenic mechanisms, this review proposes expectations for future research. These proposals include focusing on identifying biomarkers that indicate early-life pesticide exposure, investigating transgenerational effects, and seeking effective treatments for diseases arising from such exposure. This review emphasizes how to understand the pathogenic mechanisms of early-life pesticide exposure through gut microbiota and multi-omics, as well as the adverse health effects of such exposure.
