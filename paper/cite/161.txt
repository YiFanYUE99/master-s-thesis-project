DT Article
AB The MetaboAnalyst web application has been widely used for metabolomics data analysis and interpretation. Despite its user-friendliness, the web interface has presented its inherent limitations (especially for advanced users) with regard to flexibility in creating customized workflow, support for reproducible analysis, and capacity in dealing with large data. To address these limitations, we have developed a companion R package (MetaboAnalystR) based on the R code base of the web server. The package has been thoroughly tested to ensure that the same R commands will produce identical results from both interfaces. MetaboAnalystR complements the MetaboAnalyst web server to facilitate transparent, flexible and reproducible analysis of metabolomics data.
