AB Diabetes can be diagnosed by either Fasting Plasma Glucose or Hemoglobin A1c. The aim of our study was to explore the differences between the two criteria through the development of a machine learning based diabetes diagnostic algorithm and analysing the predictive contribution of each input biomarker. Our study concludes that fasting insulin is predictive of diabetes defined by FPG, but not by HbA1c. Besides, 28 other fasting blood biomarkers were not significant predictors of diabetes.
