AB Although many toxicological studies on pesticides and nanoparticles have been conducted, it is not clear whether nanoparticles will increase the toxicity of pesticides. In this study, we chose imidacloprid (IMI) as a representative pesticide, and explored the influence of ZnO NPs on the toxic effect of IMI. In addition, we studied the bioaccumulation of IMI in mice. Using biochemical index analysis, liver histopathological analysis, non-targeted metabolomics, and LC/MS analysis, we found that ZnO NPs increased the toxicity of IMI, which may be related to the increase in IMI bioaccumulation in mice. In addition, we used intestinal histopathological analysis, RT-qPCR, and 16sRNA sequencing to find that the disturbance of the gut microbiota and the impaired intestinal barrier caused by ZnO NPs may be the reason for the increase in IMI bioaccumulation. In summary, our results indicate that ZnO NPs disrupted the intestinal barrier and enhanced the bioaccumulation of IMI, and therefore increased the toxicity of IMI in mice. Our research has deepened the toxicological insights between nanomaterials and pesticides.
