AB Rice crops are constantly damaged by a variety of pests during
   cultivation, which greatly affects human food security. Metabonomic data
   can not only reflect internal physiological and biochemical changes in
   cells or organisms, but also indicate how these are affected by
   different factors. This paper reviews progress in research on the
   metabolomes of rice pests, introduces the main methods used in
   metabolomics, i.e., nuclear magnetic resonance technology and mass
   spectrometry chromatography coupling technology, and summarizes the
   application of metabolomics to rice pest research, including that on
   pesticide resistance, insect-rice interactions and insect-symbiotic
   bacteria interactions. The shortcomings of metabolomics in terms of
   accuracy, sensitivity and resolution are also discussed, as well as
   prospects for using metabolomics and other combined multi-omics
   techniques to find novel insecticidal targets, develop new biological
   pesticides and transgenic resistant rice plants, and other
   environmentally-friendly methods for the prevention and control of rice
   pests.
