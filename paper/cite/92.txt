AB Rapid and accurate detection of pesticide residue levels can help to prevent the harm of pesticide residue. This study used visible/near-infrared (Vis-NIR) (376-1044 nm) and near-infrared (NIR) (915-1699 nm) hyperspectral imaging systems (HISs) to detect the level of pesticide residues. Three different varieties of grapes were sprayed with four levels of pesticides. Logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), convolutional neural network (CNN), and residual neural network (ResNet) models were used to build classification models for pesticide residue levels. The saliency maps of CNN and ResNet were conducted to visualize the contribution of wavelengths. Overall, the results of NIR spectra performed better than those of Vis-NIR spectra. For Vis-NIR spectra, the best model was ResNet, with the accuracy of over 93%. For NIR spectra, LR was the best, with the accuracy of over 97%, but SVM, CNN, and ResNet also showed closed and fine results. The saliency map of CNN and ResNet presented similar and closed ranges of crucial wavelengths. Overall results indicated deep learning performed better than conventional machine learning. The study showed that the use of hyperspectral imaging technology combined with machine learning can effectively detect the level of pesticide residues in grapes.
