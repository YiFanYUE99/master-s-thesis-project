AB Reproductive disorders are a serious public health problem worldwide. Epidemiological data suggest that exposure to environmental pollutants is associated with the onset of reproductive disorders. However, the effects in reproductive health and exact mechanism of action of representative agricultural compounds prothioconazole (PTC) and its metabolite prothioconazole-desthio (dPTC) on mammals remain unclear. Here, we studied the physiological effects of the exposure to environmentally relevant doses of PTC and dPTC in mice reproductive systems. Combining in vivo, in vitro, and in silico studies, we observed that PTC and dPTC disrupt reproductive health by inducing metabolic perturbation, induction of apoptosis, and inflammation in gonadal tissue, which are achieved via activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Convincingly, the addition of alternate-day injections of CH223191 (an AhR inhibitor) to the 30-day exposure regimen ameliorated ovarian tissue damage, as evidenced by decreased TUNEL-positive cells and partially restored the inflammation and apoptotic factor levels. This study comprehensively reports the toxic effects of low-dose PTC and dPTC in the reproductive system in vivo and identifies AhR as a potential therapeutic target for the amelioration of reproductive disorders caused by similar endocrine-disrupting chemicals.
