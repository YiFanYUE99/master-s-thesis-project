AB As a common fungicide, tebuconazole are ubiquitous in the natural environment and poses many potential risks. In this study, we examined the effects of exposure to tebuconazole on colitis in mice and explored its underlying mechanism. Specifically, exposure to tebuconazole could cause structural damage and inflammatory cell infiltration in colon tissue, activate the expression of inflammation-related genes, disrupt the expression of barrier function-related genes, and induce the colonic inflammation in mice. Similarly, exposure to tebuconazole could also exacerbate DSS-induced colitis in mice. In addition, we found that tebuconazole also could change the composition of the gut microbiota. In particular, tebuconazole significantly increases the relative abundance of Akkermansia of mice. Moreover, tebuconazole resulted in metabolic profiles disorders of the serum, leading to significant changes in the relative contents of metabolites involving glycolipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism. Particularly, the results of the gut microbiota transplantation experiment showed that exposure to tebuconazole could induced colonic inflammation in mice in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. Taken together, these results indicated that tebuconazole could induce colitis in mice via regulating gut microbiota. Our findings strongly support the concept that the gut microbiota is a key trigger of inflammatory bowel disease caused by pesticide intake.
