AB Alpha-cypermethrin (alpha-CP), [(RS)-a-cyano-3-phenoxy benzyl (1RS)-cis-3-(2, 2-dichlorovinyl)-2, 2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate], comprises a diastereoisomer pair of cypermethrin, which are (+)-(1R-cis-alpha S)-CP (insecticidal) and (-)-(1S-cis-alpha R)-CP (inactive). In this experiment, the stereoselective degradation of alpha-CP was investigated in rat liver microsomes by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a cellulose-tris- (3, 5-dimethylphenylcarbamate)-based chiral stationary phase. The results revealed that the degradation of (-)-(1S-cis-alpha R)-CP was much faster than (+)-(1R-cis-alpha S)-CP both in enantiomer monomers and rac-alpha-CP. As for the enzyme kinetic parameters, there were some variances between rac-alpha-CP and the enantiomer monomers. In rac-alpha-CP, the V-max and CLint of (+)-(1R-cis-alpha S)-CP (5105.22 +/- 326.26 nM/min/mg protein and 189.64 mL/min/mg protein) were about one-half of those of (-)-(1S-cis-alpha R)-CP (9308.57 +/- 772.24 nM/min/mg protein and 352.19 mL/min/mg protein), while the Km of the two alpha-CP enantiomers were similar. However, in the enantiomer monomers of alpha-CP, the V-max and K-m of (+)-(1R-cis-alpha S) -CP were 2-fold and 5-fold of (-)-(1S-cis-alpha R)-CP, respectively, which showed a significant difference with rac-alpha-CP. The CLint of (+)-(1R-cis-alpha S)-CP (140.97 mL/min/mg protein) was still about one-half of (-)-(1S-cis-alpha R)-CP (325.72 mL/min/mg protein) in enantiomer monomers. The interaction of enantiomers of alpha-CP in rat liver microsomes was researched and the results showed that there were different interactions between the IC50 of (-)- to (+)-(1R-cis-alpha S)-CP and (+)- to (-)-(1S-cis-alpha R)-CP(IC50(-)/(+) / IC50(+)/(-)=0.61).
