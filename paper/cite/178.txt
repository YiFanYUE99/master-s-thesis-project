AB A new approach for variable influence on projection (VIP) is described, which takes full advantage of the orthogonal projections to latent structures (OPLS) model formalism for enhanced model interpretability. This means that it will include not only the predictive components in OPLS but also the orthogonal components. Four variants of variable influence on projection (VIP) adapted to OPLS have been developed, tested and compared using three different data sets, one synthetic with known properties and two real-world cases.
