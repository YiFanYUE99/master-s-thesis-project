AB Neonicotinoids, widely used on farmland, are ubiquitous in food; however, their distribution among various crops and associated exposure risks at the provincial level in China remain unclear. We collected 19 types of crop samples (fruits, vegetables, and tea) from farmland in nine prefectural cities in Zhejiang Province, China. We analyzed nine commonly used neonicotinoids in the edible portions of these crops. A notable detection rate (42.1 %-82.9 %) and high residual neonicotinoid concentrations (278 +/- 357 ng/g) were observed. Tea exhibited the highest residue, followed by fruits, and vegetables showed the lowest (P < 0.05). Neonicotinoid ratios in crops to soil (R_C/S) and soil to water (R_S/W) were defined to discern insecticide distribution across different environments. Increased water solubility leads to increased migration of neonicotinoids (R_S/W) from agricultural soils to water through runoff, thereby increasing the relative contribution of nitenpyram and dinotefuran in water. In comparison with other studied compounds, all crops demonstrated the strongest soil uptake of thiamethoxam, denoted by the highest R_C/S value. Elevated R_C/S values in tea, pickled cabbage, and celery suggest increased susceptibility of these crops to neonicotinoid absorption from the soil (P < 0.05). Estimated dietary intake for teenagers, adults and elders was 8.9 +/- 0.5, 8.9 +/- 0.6, and 8.8 +/- 0.3 mu g/kg/d, respectively, below the reference dose (57 mu g/kg/d). Teenagers, compared to adults and elders, exhibited significantly higher neonicotinoid exposure through fruit consumption, emphasizing the need for increased attention to neonicotinoid exposure among vulnerable populations.
