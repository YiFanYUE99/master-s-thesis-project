AB Prothioconazole (PTC), a popular agricultural fungicide, and its main metabolite prothioconazole-desthio (PTCd) are receiving great attention due to their toxicological effects in the non-target organisms. This study investigated their dosage-dependent (1 and 5 mg/kg BW/day) toxicological effects on oxidative stress and metabolic profiles of liver and kidney tissues using male mice. PTC and PTCd significantly inhibited the growth phenotype including body weights gain, liver and kidney indices. Furthermore, these effects were deeply investigated using the biomarkers of oxidative stress, and metabolomics. Notably, these effects were dose and tissue-dependent. Specifically, the more serious impacts involving oxidative stress and metabolic disorders were observed in the high concentration treatment groups. Also, the liver tissue was more severely affected than the kidney tissue. Lastly, the change in oxidative stress biomarkers and metabolomics profile revealed that PTCd induced more severe toxic effects than the parent compound PTC. In brief, these results indicate that exposure to PTC and PTCd could cause potential health risks in mammals. (C)2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
