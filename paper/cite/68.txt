AB BACKGROUND: Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is a major determinant of perinatal morbidity and mortality, with adverse long-term neurocognitive effects in childhood and adulthood. Prenatal exposure to environmental pollutants has been reported to be associated with FGR. Neonicotinoids (NEOs) are extensively used insecticides worldwide and are suggested to have embryonic and developmental neurotoxicity. However, the effects of NEOs exposure on FGR is unknown.; OBJECTIVES: We aimed to quantify the single and combined associations of maternal exposure to NEOs and FGR.; METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study based on the Guangxi Zhuang Birth Cohort, China. A total of 387 with FGR cases and 1096 without- FGR controls were included between 2015 and 2018. Ten NEOs were measured by UPLC-MS from the maternal blood samples were pre-collected in the first trimester. After adjusting for potential confounders, multivariable logistic regressions, weighted quantile sum regression and quantile g-computation were performed for individual and NEOs mixtures.; RESULTS: In the individual exposure models, each 1-standard deviation increment of the natural-log in dinotefuran and acetamiprid concentrations were significantly associated with odds ratios of 1.93 (95% CI: 1.69, 2.20) and 1.31 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.59) higher odds of FGR, respectively. However, the FGR risk was negatively associated with thiacloprid, sulfoxaflor, and nitenpyram (OR=0.23, 95%CI: 0.15, 0.34; OR=0.48, 95%CI: 0.41, 0.56; OR=0.86, 95%CI: 0.80, 0.93; respectively). Similar findings were found in the combined exposure analysis. Dinotefuran was the most strongly attributable to increase FGR, while sulfoxaflor and thiacloprid contributed the highest negative weighted on FGR. Furthermore, each quintile increase in all ten NEOs exposures was associated with FGR (OR=0.21, 95% CI: 0.08, 0.54).; CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that maternal single and combined exposures to NEOs were associated with varying FGR risks. They contribute to the mounting evidence on serum NEOs exposure impact on FGR. However, a replication of these associations in other populations is warranted. Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
