AB Pesticides are xenobiotic molecules necessary to control pests in agriculture, home, and industry. However, water and soil can become contaminated as a consequence of their extensive use. Therefore, because of its eco-friendly characteristics and efficiency, bioremediation of contaminated sites is a powerful tool with advantages over other kinds of treatments. For an efficient pesticides bioremediation, it is necessary to take into account different aspects related to the microbial metabolism and physiology. In this respect, OMICs studies such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics are essential to generate relevant information about the genes and proteins involved in pesticide degradation, the metabolites generated by microbial pesticide degradation, and the cellular strategies to contend against stress caused by pesticide exposition. Pesticides as organochlorines and organophosphorus are the more commonly studied using OMIC approaches. To date, many genomes of microorganisms capable of degrading pesticides have been published, mainly bacterial strains from Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, and Rhodococcus genera. Following the genomic reports, transcriptomic studies, using microarrays and more recently next-generation sequencing technology RNA-Seq, in pesticide microbial degradation are the most numerous. Proteomics, metabolomics, as well as studies that combine different OMIC are gained interest. This review aims to describe a brief overview of pesticide biodegradation mechanisms; new tools to study microorganisms in natural environments; basic concepts of the OMICs approaches; as well as advances in methodologies associated with the analysis of that tools. Additionally, the most recent reports on genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics during the degradation of pesticides are also analyzed.
