AB The accuracy of the structural annotation of unidentified peaks obtained in metabolomic analysis using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) can be enhanced using retention time (RT) information as well as precursor and product ions. Unified-hydrophilic-interaction/anion-exchange liquid chromatography high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (unified-HILIC/AEX/HRMS/MS) has been recently developed as an innovative method ideal for nontargeted polar metabolomics. However, the RT prediction for unified-HILIC/AEX has not been developed because of the complex separation mechanism characterized by the continuous transition of the separation modes from HILIC to AEX. In this study, we propose an RT prediction model of unified-HILIC/AEX/HRMS/MS, which enables the comprehensive structural annotation of polar metabolites. With training data for 203 polar metabolites, we ranked the feature importance using a random forest among 12,420 molecular descriptors (MDs) and constructed an RT prediction model with 26 selected MDs. The accuracy of the RT model was evaluated using test data for 51 polar metabolites, and 86.3% of the Delta RTs (difference between measured and predicted RTs) were within +/- 1.50 min, with a mean absolute error of 0.80 min, indicating high RT prediction accuracy. Nontargeted metabolomic data from the NIST SRM 1950-Metabolites in frozen human plasma were analyzed using the developed RT model and in silico MS/MS prediction, resulting in a successful structural estimation of 216 polar metabolites, in addition to the 62 identified based on standards. The proposed model can help accelerate the structural annotation of unknown hydrophilic metabolites, which is a key issue in metabolomic research.
