AB In the past few decades, the toxic effects of environmental pollutants on non-target organisms have received more and more attention. As a new omics technology, metabolomics can clarify the metabolic homeostasis of the organism at the overall level by studying the changes in the relative contents of endogenous metabolites in the organism. Recently, a large number of studies have used metabolomics technology to study the toxic effects of environmental pollutants on organisms. In this review, we reviewed the analysis processes and data processes of metabolomics and its application in the study of the toxic effects of environmental pollutants including heavy metals, pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polybrominated diphenyl ethers and microplastics. In addition, we emphasized that the combination of metabolomics and other omics technologies will help to explore the toxic mechanism of environmental pollutants and provide new research ideas for the toxicological evaluation of environmental pollutants.
