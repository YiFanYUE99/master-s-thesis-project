AB Background Oxidative stress may be an important mechanism linking pesticide exposure to several diseases. We evaluated the association between pesticide exposures and oxidative stress biomarkers in Brazilian agricultural workers. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in healthy agricultural (N = 52) and non-agricultural workers (N = 68) in a rural community in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Regular pesticide use, sociodemographic, and lifestyle information was obtained by questionnaire. Oxidative stress biomarkers (N = 7) were measured in serum and plasma. We calculated percent differences and 95% confidence intervals (CI) in oxidative stress biomarkers for use of pesticides adjusted for sex, age, education, smoking, and alcohol consumption, using multiple linear regression. Results Living close to or in the fields was associated with glutathione peroxidase activity but not with any other markers. We observed significant positive associations between 8-isoprostane levels and activities of glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione-S-transferase with reported use of certain insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides. Our results also indicate a significant and negative association between glutathione-S-transferase activity and insecticide use. Conclusions These findings suggest that use of pesticides may be associated with differences in oxidative stress biomarkers.
