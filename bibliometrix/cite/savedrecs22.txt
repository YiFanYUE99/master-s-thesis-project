AB Exposure to chiral pesticides poses many potential health risks. In this study, we examined the impacts of exposure to penconazole and its enantiomers on gut microbiota and metabolic profiles in mice. The relative abundance of microbiota in cecal content significantly changed following exposure to penconazole and its enantiomers. At the genus level, the relative abundances of seven gut microflora were altered following exposure to (-)-penconazole. Both (+/-)-penconazole and (+)-penconazole caused significant changes in the relative abundances of five gut microflora. In addition, targeted serum metabolomics analysis showed disturbed metabolic profiles following exposure. Respectively, (+/-)-penconazole, (+)-penconazole, and (-)-penconazole exposure significantly altered the relative levels of 29, 23, and 36 metabolites. In general, exposure to penconazole and its enantiomers caused disorders in gut microbiota and metabolic profiles of mice. The potential health risks of penconazole and its enantiomers now require further evaluation.
