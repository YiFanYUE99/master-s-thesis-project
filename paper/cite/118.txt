AB Scientific information is not yet available to provide insight into how individual metabolome might be affected by thepresence of pesticides in regular diets. This study aimed to evaluate the perturbation of metabolomic pathways in children whoswitched their diets from conventional foods to mostly organic foods forfive consecutive days. We selected 46 child-matched spoturine samples with distinct differences of urinary pesticide metabolite levels between the conventional and organic eating days andthen analyzed those urine samples on three analytical platforms to perform global metabolomics analysis. We found statisticallysignificant perturbations of metabolic pathways relevant to inflammation, oxidative stress, and the demands of xenobioticdetoxification when children switched their conventional diets to mostly organic foods. The outcomes of this study allow us toextend the current understanding beyond organophosphate pesticides'acute toxicity of cholinesterase inhibition to the perturbationof metabolic pathways at dietary intake levels.
