AB Since neonicotinoids (NNIs) are widely used around the world, they are extensively distributed in the environment and frequently occurred in humans. This study was conducted to assess the risk of NNIs residues in vegetables and fruits in Henan province, and evaluate the associations of NNIs single and mixed exposure with glucose metabolism, and further explore whether testosterone mediated these relationships in Henan rural population. The data of vegetables and fruits were collected from Henan Province in 2020-2021, and participants were drawn from the Henan Rural Cohort study. Hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI) were used to assess the risk of exposure to the individual and combined NNIs through vegetables or fruits intake. Relative potency factor (RPF) method was utilized to normalize each NNIs to imidacloprid (IMIRPF). Generalized linear models were used to explore the effects of each NNIs and IMIRPF on glucose metabolism. Weight quartile sum (WQS) regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) model were applied to estimate the effect of NNIs mixtures on glucose metabolism. Mediation analysis was employed to explore whether testosterone mediated these relationships. The HQs and HI in both vegetables and fruits were much lower than 1, which indicated that NNIs in vegetables and fruits were not expected to cause significant adverse effects. However, plasma natural logarithm nitenpyram (Ln_NIT), Ln_thiacloprid-amid (Ln_THD-A), and Ln_IMIeq were positively associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)): 1.12 (1.05, 1.19), 1.21 (1.10, 1.32), and 1.48 (1.22, 1.80)). Both WQS regression and BKMR models observed significantly positive associations between NNIs mixture exposure and T2DM. Testosterone partially mediated these associations among women (PE = 6.67%). These findings suggest that human NNIs exposure may impair glucose metabolism and could contribute to rising rates of T2DM, and it's necessary to regulate the use of pesticides in rural areas.
