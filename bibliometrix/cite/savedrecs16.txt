AB In this study, the metabolic responses of mice after 30 days of exposure to benalaxyl were assessed using NMR-based untargeted metabolomics and LC-MS-based targeted profiling of 20 amino acids. Urinary H-1 NMR analyses revealed alterations in energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, vitamin B metabolism, the urea cycle and amino acid metabolism, and targeted analyses indicated that the serum levels of asparagine, histidine, lysine and aspartic acid were significantly altered. Additionally, significant oxidative stress was observed in the liver and kidney, although no apparent histopathological injury was observed. The tissue distribution indicated a significant stereoselectivity in the brain, where (-)-R-benalaxyl was enriched. These data provide a comprehensive picture of the subacute toxic effects of benalaxyl in mice. The results of this study suggested that, for a toxicity evaluation, metabolomics analysis is much more sensitive than traditional toxicological methods. The results also highlight the combined use of untargeted and targeted metabolomics approaches in evaluating the health risks of xenobiotics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
