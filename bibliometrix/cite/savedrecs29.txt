AB As an agricultural fungicide, penconazole (PEN) is widely used and has adverse effects on various organisms. In order to evaluate the ecological safety risks of PEN, the bioaccumulation and toxic effects of PEN in earthworms were studied. Specifically, the results show that the biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) of PEN in earthworms reaches its maximum within 1 day, and then decreases slowly. It reached its lowest value after 14 days of PEN exposure and then rose again. In addition, oxidative stress and metabolic disorder of the earthworm with PEN exposure were assessed. After PEN exposure, the related indicators of oxidative stress involved in the activities of SOD and CAT and the contents of GSH and MDA all changed significantly in earthworms. Moreover, metabolomics analysis of earthworms showed disturbed metabolic profiles following PEN exposure. Respectively, PEN exposure significantly altered the relative abundances of 14 metabolites in earthworms. In general, exposure to PEN caused oxidative stress and metabolic profile disorders of earthworms. The results of this study will be helpful for further evaluation of soil ecological security of PEN.
