AB As a part of system biology, metabolomics is widely used in biomedical
   research because of its fast analysis. At present, the studies of
   metabolomics in environmental toxicology mainly focus on single
   pollutants, and the complex situation of contaminated areas should also
   be considered. The application of metabolomics in environmental
   toxicology was reviewed by introducing metabolomics and its development
   process. We also summarized the respective characteristics of the
   current mainstream metabolomics technology, and discussed the research
   and application progress of metabolomics in the toxicity evaluation of
   environmental heavy metals, organic pollutants and antibiotics, and
   environmental stress tolerance evaluation. At last, we pointed point out
   that the application of metabolomics in environmental toxicology needs
   to be strengthened. The paper was expected to provide reference for the
   application reasearch of metabonomics in environmental toxicology.
