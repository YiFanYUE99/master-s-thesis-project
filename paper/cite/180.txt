AB Pesticides are a group of chemicals used for pest control in agriculture
   and forestry.In addition to occupational population,general population
   also has a chance to be exposed to such chemicals via various ways.The
   relationship between human health and pesticides exposure is very
   complicated.The data on the health effects of long-term exposure to
   pesticides are limited and often controversial in human health risk
   assessments.The management of pesticides requires scientific data,but at
   present there are very few toxicological data for most pesticides and
   few human health data related to pesticides.Government agencies should
   establish a monitoring system after pesticide registration and marketing
   to evaluate the potential adverse effects of pesticides
   exposure.Pesticides enterprises must be enforced to implement the
   obligations that all occupationally exposed workers can get
   comprehensive occupational health surveillance.Professionals should also
   pay attention to potential health risks of pesticide exposure.In a
   word,let pesticides benefit our life and avoid any damage to our health.
Z4 农药是一类用于农林业控制虫害的化学品。农药的暴露对象除了职业接触人群,还有环境暴露的整个社会人群。农药暴露与健康的关系非常复杂。除了急性中毒外,
   有关长期接触对健康影响的人群数据一直比较有限,在进行人群健康风险评估时常受到争议。农药的管理需要科学数据,但目前绝大多数农药并无丰富的毒理学数据
   ,人群健康关系的数据更是缺乏。建议政府建立农药登记、上市后的人群监测制度,关注农药暴露与健康的关系;应要求生产企业承诺建立更广泛的化学物接触与健
   康监护的联系机制;专业人员应关注农药暴露的潜在健康风险。让农药造福于公众,避免其对人群健康的损害。
