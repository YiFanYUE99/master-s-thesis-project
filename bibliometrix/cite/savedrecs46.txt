AB As the most commonly used organochlorine pesticide nowadays, chlorothalonil (CHI), is ubiquitous in a natural environment and poses many adverse effects to organisms. Unfortunately, the toxicity mechanisms of CHI have not been clarified yet. This study found that the CHI based on ADI level could induce obesity in mice. In addition, CHI could induce an imbalance in the gut microbiota of mice. Furthermore, the results of the antibiotic treatment and gut microbiota transplantation experiments showed that the CHI could induce obesity in mice in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. Based on the results of targeted metabolomics and gene expression analysis, CHI could disturb the bile acids (BAs) metabolism of mice, causing the inhibition of the signal response of BAs re-ceptor FXR and leading to glycolipid metabolism disorders in liver and epiWAT of mice. The administration of FXR agonist GW4064 and CDCA could significantly improve the CHI-induced obesity in mice. In conclusion, CHI was found to induce obesity in mice by regulating the gut microbiota and BAs metabolism via the FXR signaling pathway. This study provides evidence linking the gut microbiota and pesticides exposure with the progression of obesity, demonstrating the key role of gut microbiota in the toxic effects of pesticides.
