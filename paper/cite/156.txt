TI Phenonaut: multiomics data integration for phenotypic space exploration
SO BIOINFORMATICS

DT Article
AB Data integration workflows for multiomics data take many forms across academia and industry. Efforts with limited resources often encountered in academia can easily fall short of data integration best practices for processing and combining high-content imaging, proteomics, metabolomics, and other omics data. We present Phenonaut, a Python software package designed to address the data workflow needs of migration, control, integration, and auditability in the application of literature and proprietary techniques for data source and structure agnostic workflow creation.
