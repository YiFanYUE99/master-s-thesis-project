AB In this study, H-1 NMR based metabolomics analysis, LC-MS/MS based serum metabolomics and histopathology techniques were used to investigate the toxic effects of subacute exposure to two types of pyrethroid insecticides bifenthrin and lambda-cyhalothrin in mice. Metabolomic analysis of tissues extracts and serum showed that these two types of pyrethroid insecticides resulted in alterations of metabolites in the liver, kidney and serum of mice. Based on the altered metabolites, several significant pathways were identified, which are associated with gut microbial metabolism, lipid metabolism, nucleotide catabolism, tyrosine metabolism and energy metabolism. The results showed that bifenthrin and lambda-cyhalothrin have similarities in disruption of metabolic pathways in kidney, indicating that the toxicological mechanisms of these two types of insecticides have some likeness to each other. This study may provide novel insight into revealing differences of toxicological mechanisms between these two types of pyrethroid insecticides.
