AB Imazethapyr (IMZT) is a typical chiral pesticide with two enantiomers with the R-IMZT having the main herbicidal activity. However, the enantioselectivity of the effects of IMZT enantiomers on human and animals is still unclear. In this study, a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics method and determination of oxidative stress were used to evaluate the enantioselectivity of IMZT enantiomers in mice. The results showed that the R-IMZT caused larger disturbances of endogenous metabolites and the S-IMZT had stronger interferences to oxidation defense system. The significantly perturbed metabolic pathways in mice exposed to the R-enantiomer were the valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis pathway as well as the phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis pathway. However, exposure of mice to the S-enantiomer did not significantly affect the metabolic pathways, but exposure led to an increase of catalase (CAT) activity and an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the liver. These results indicate that we need to conduct a more comprehensive assessment of the health risks of pesticide monomers in the future. In a word, these results provide more evidence for assessing the differences in health risks of IMZT enantiomers to mammals as well as provide more references for the promotion and use of pesticide monomers in the future.
