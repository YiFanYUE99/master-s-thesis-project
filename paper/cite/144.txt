AB Advances in computational and data processing technology have enabled the development of many novel tools for analyzing metabolomic and lipidomic data. These advances involved the catalyst for the creation of publicly accessible complex web-based databases such as the Metabolomics Workbench. Open Source internet-based software packages such as MetaboAnalyst 5.0 enable researchers to perform a wide range of analyte identification and statistical analyses of their own and other researchers' data in order to identify biomarkers and classify compounds. In this paper, we set forth a protocol for obtaining experimental data of interest from a public data repository (Metabolomics Workbench), converting the data into a format suitable for submission to MetaboAnalyst 5.0, and then uploading the data to the MetaboAnalyst server for identification and statistical analysis. © 2023.
