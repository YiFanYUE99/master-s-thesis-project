AB Pesticides are widely used worldwide, but their toxic effects pose a
   serious threat to humans and non-target organisms in the environment.
   The traditional evaluation methods have limited observation indicators,
   low evaluation efficiency, and insufficient sensitivity, which cannot
   fully meet the current evaluation needs. As a new research method,
   metabolomics studies the metabolic activities and states of living
   organisms from the overall level. It has the advantages of comprehensive
   evaluation, high evaluation efficiency and high sensitivity. It has been
   widely used in the study of pesticide environmental toxicology. This
   paper reviews the progress of metabolomics research and its application
   in pesticide environmental toxicology.
