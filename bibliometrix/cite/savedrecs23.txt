AB Although metabolic perturbations are sensitive indicators for low-dose toxic effects, the metabolic mechanisms affected by rac-metalaxyl and metalaxyl-M in mammals from a metabolic profiling perspective remain unclear. In this study, the metabolic perturbations and toxic effects of rac-metalaxyl and metalaxyl-M in mice were carefully investigated using integrative nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) based metabolomics. Histopathology, NMR-based untargeted urine profile, multivariate pattern recognition, metabolite identification, pathway analysis, UPLC-MS/MS based targeted serum amino acids, and tryptophan pathway analysis were determined after rac-metalaxyl and metalaxyl-M exposure, individually. Histopathology indicated that metalaxyl-M induced greater hepatocellular inflammatory, necrosis, and vacuolation in mice than rac-metalaxyl at the same exposure dosage. The metabolic perturbations induced by rac-metalaxyl and metalaxyl-M were directly separated using partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Furthermore, metabolite identification and pathway analysis indicated that rac-metalaxyl mainly induced ten urine metabolite changes and four pathway fluctuations. However, metalaxyl-M induced 19 urine metabolite changes and six pathway fluctuations. Serum amino acids and tryptophan pathway metabolite changes induced by rac-metalaxyl and metalaxyl-M were also different even at the same exposure level. Such results may provide specific insight into the metabolic perturbations and toxic effects of rac-metalaxyl and metalaxyl-M, and contribute to providing available data for health risk assessments of rac-metalaxyl and metalaxyl-M at a metabolomics level.
