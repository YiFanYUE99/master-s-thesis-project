AB Neonicotinoids are increasingly being used for pest control, and their potential health risks are now receiving attention. In this study, the toxic effects of three neonicotinoids (dinotefuran, nitenpyram and acetamiprid) were evaluated in ICR mice. After 30 days of exposure to neonicotinoids (1/200 LD50), oxidative stress levels, biochemical parameters, free fatty acids contents, and H-1 NMR-based hepatic metabolomics were tested. All treatment groups showed signs of amino acid metabolism disorders especially elevated branched chain amino acids and phenylalanine. Furthermore, animals exposed to neonicotinoids had elevated lipid levels, which induced oxidative stress. Overall, we found that oxidative stress is a common toxic effect of exposure to neonicotinoids. In addition, lipid accumulation induced by amino acid metabolism disorder may be the cause of oxidative stress. Our results further our understanding of the toxicological effects of neonicotinoids on mammals. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
