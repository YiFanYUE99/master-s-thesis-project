AB Aim: To ascertain the toxicity levels and field control efficacy of
   bioinsecticides and neonicotinoid insecticides against Amrasca biguttula
   nymphs, so as to provide a scientific basis for its control. Methods:
   The median lethal concentration (LC50) values of three bioinsecticides
   (veratramine, avermectin and matrine), and five neonicotinoid
   insecticides (nitenpyram, imidaclothiz, dinotefuran, thiamethoxam and
   acetamiprid) against the 3rd instar nymphs ofA. biguttulain North Hunan
   cotton area were determined at 24 h after treatment using leaf-dipping
   method in laboratory. Based on the recommended field application rate of
   each insecticide, the field control efficacy of 0.5% veratramine soluble
   concentrate (SL) (5.625 g a.i./hm2), 5% avermectin emulsifiable
   concentrate (EC)(10.5 g a.i./hm2), 2% matrine aqueous solution (AS)
   (10.5 g a.i./hm2), 10% nitenpyram AS (30 g a.i./hm2), 40% imidaclothiz
   water dispersible granule (WG) (30 g a.i./hm2), 20% dinotefuran
   suspension concentrate (SC) (75 g a.i./hm2), 30% thiamethoxam SC (33.75
   g a.i./hm2) and 5% acetamiprid EC (18 g a.i./hm2) againstA. biguttulawas
   evaluated by using artificial spraying in Taoyuan County, Hunan during
   the occurrence peak ofA. biguttulain August, 2021. Results: The
   laboratory toxicity assessment result revealed that at 24 h after
   treatment, the toxicity of the eight insecticides toA. biguttulanymphs
   was ranked in a descending order as follows: 0.5% veratramine SL>5%
   avermectin ES>10% nitenpyram AS>40% imidaclothiz WG>20% dinotefuran
   SC>2% matrine AS>30% thiamethoxam SC>5% acetamiprid EC. The
   bioinsecticides 0.5% veratramine SC and 5% avermectin EC had the
   LC50values of 1.79 and 4.00 mg/L against the 3rd instar nymphs ofA.
   biguttula, respectively, exhibiting higher toxicity than the five tested
   neonicotinoid insecticides. Field control efficacy experiment results
   showed that 0.5% veratramine SL had the best field control efficacy
   againstA. biguttula, with the corrected control efficacy of 91.36% at 1
   d after application, significanly higher than that of the other
   insecticides. At 7 and 14 d after application, the field corrected
   control efficacy of 0.5% veratramine SL againstA. biguttulawas 86.14%
   and 80.09%, respectively, only lower than that of 20% dinotefuran SC
   (92.02% and 86.99%, respectively), showing no significant difference
   from that of 10% nitenpyram AS and 40% imidaclothiz WG, and
   significantly higher than that of the other insecticides. Conclusion:
   These results suggest that veratramine and nitenpyram show good indoor
   insecticidal activities and field control efficacy againstA.
   biguttulapopulations in North Hunan cotton area. To reduce the improper
   use of insecticides and promote the synergistic application of chemical
   and biopesticides, we recommend that veratramine and nitenpyram should
   be used alternately to controlA. biguttulain cotton fields.
