AB Pesticides are recognized as common environmental contaminants. The potential pesticide hazard to non-target organisms, including various mammal species, is a global concern. The global problem requires a comprehensive risk assessment. To assess the toxic effects of pesticides at the early stage, a toxicological risk analysis is conducted to determine pesticide hazard levels. World Health Organization (WHO) has established five pesticide hazard classes based on lethal dose (LD50) values to perform these assessments. In this paper, we have developed one-vs-all quantitative structure-activity relationship (OvA-QSAR) models using five machine-learning techniques with the selected optimum molecular descriptors. Descriptor selection was conducted based on correlation to evaluate the relevance and significance of individual features in our dataset. Our OvA-QSAR model was built using a dataset obtained from the WHO, covering a wide range of chemical pesticides. These models can predict the hazard category for a pesticide within the five available categories. Notably, our experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance and robustness of the Random Forest (RF) model in addressing the challenge of multi-class classification with the selected descriptors.
